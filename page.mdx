# What are CSS Selectors?
CSS selectors are patterns used to select and style HTML elements. They allow you to target specific elements on a web page to apply CSS rules.

## Types of CSS Selectors
- **Universal Selector (`*`)**: Selects all elements on the page.
- **Type Selector**: Selects all elements of a specific type (e.g., `
    p`, `div`, `h1`).
- **Class Selector (`.className`)**: Selects all elements with a specific class attribute.
- **ID Selector (`#idName`)**: Selects a single element with a specific ID attribute.
- **Attribute Selector (`[attribute=value]`)**: Selects elements with a specific attribute value.
- **Descendant Selector (`ancestor descendant`)**: Selects all elements that are descendants of a specified ancestor element.
- **Child Selector (`parent > child`)**: Selects all elements that are direct children of a specified parent element.
- **Adjacent Sibling Selector (`element1 + element2`)**: Selects the element that is immediately preceded by a specified sibling element.
- **General Sibling Selector (`element1 ~ element2`)**: Selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.

## CSS Selector Specificity
CSS selector specificity determines which CSS rule is applied to an element when multiple rules could apply. It is calculated based on the types of selectors used in the rule.
