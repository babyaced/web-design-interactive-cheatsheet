# What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. 

HTML pages are called documents and are made up of elements that define the structure and content of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document
An HTML document typically starts with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>` tag that encloses the entire document. 

Inside the `<html>` tag, there are two main sections: the `<head>` and the `<body>`.
### Head Section
The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character set, and links to your stylesheets or javascript files. The most common elements found in the `<head>` section include:

- **`<title>`**: Specifies the title of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.
```html
<title>My First HTML Page</title>
```
- **`<meta>`**: Provides metadata about the HTML document, such as character encoding and viewport settings.
    - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. This is essential for ensuring that the text displays correctly.
    ```html
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
    ```
    - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Ensures that the webpage is responsive and displays correctly on different devices.
    ```html
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    ```
- **`<link>`**: Used to link external resources, such as stylesheets.
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    ```
- **`<script>`**: Used to include or reference JavaScript files that add interactivity to the webpage.
    ```html
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    ```

### Body Section
The `<body>` section contains the content of the webpage, which can include text, images, links, and other media. This is what users see and interact with in their web browsers.

### Example of a Simple HTML File
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text on my first HTML page.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have a simple HTML document with a title, a heading, a paragraph, and a link. Each element is defined by its respective tags, such as `<h1>` for the heading and `<p>` for the paragraph.

That's the basics of HTML! With this foundation, you can start adding HTML elements to create your own web pages.
