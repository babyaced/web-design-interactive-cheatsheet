# What is HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages, and they are represented by tags. These tags define the structure and content of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

## Basic Structure of an HTML Document
An HTML document typically starts with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>` tag that encloses the entire document. Inside the `<html>` tag, there are two main sections: the `<head>` and the `<body>`.
### Head Section
The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the document, such as the title, character set, and links to your stylesheets or javascript files.
### Body Section
The `<body>` section contains the content of the webpage, which can include text, images, links, and other media. This is what users see and interact with in their web browsers.

### Example of a Simple HTML File
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text on my first HTML page.</p>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have a simple HTML document with a title, a heading, a paragraph, and a link. Each element is defined by its respective tags, such as `<h1>` for the heading and `<p>` for the paragraph.
