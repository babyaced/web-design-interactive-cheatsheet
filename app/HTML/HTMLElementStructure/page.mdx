# HTML Element Structure

HTML Elements consist of opening and closing tags, attributes, and content. Understanding the structure of HTML elements is crucial for creating well-formed web pages.

## Opening and Closing Tags
Every HTML element has an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag contains the type of element, and the closing tag is the same as the opening tag but with a forward slash (`/`) before the element's name.
The `<` and `>` symbols are used to denote the start and end of a tag. These symbols are called **angle brackets**.
### Example


### Self-Closing Tags
Some HTML elements are self-closing, meaning they do not need a closing tag. These elements include `<img>`, `<br>`, and `<input>`.
For these elements, the opening and closing tags are combined into a single tag. The tag is ended with a slash before the closing angle bracket.

### Example

{/* <HTMLCSSJSPlayground folderPath={"HTML/HTMLElementStructure/SelfClosingTag"} /> */}



## Attributes
Attributes provide additional information about an element. They are always specified in the opening tag and come in name/value pairs like this: `name="value"`.

### Example
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
```

## Content
Content is the information or elements within a pair of opening and closing tags. It can include text, images, links, and other HTML elements.

### Example
```html
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<p>This is a <strong>bold</strong> statement.</p>
