# What are HTML Elements?

HTML Elements are the building blocks of HTML documents. They define the structure and content of a webpage by using tags to represent different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.


## HTML Element Structure

HTML Elements consist of opening and closing tags, attributes, and content. Understanding the structure of HTML elements is crucial for creating web pages.

### Opening and Closing Tags
Every HTML element has an **opening tag** and a **closing tag**.

The **opening tag** contains the type/name of element. 

The **closing tag** is the same as the opening tag but with a forward slash (`/`) before the element's name.

The `<` and `>` symbols are used to mark the start and end of an opening or closing tag. These `<>` symbols are called **angle brackets**.

##### Self-Closing Elements
Some HTML elements are self-closing, meaning they do not need a closing tag. These elements include `<img>`, `<br>`, and `<input>`.
For these elements, the opening and closing tags are combined into a single tag. The tag is ended with a slash before the closing angle bracket.

###  Attributes
You may have noticed that the examples above include some other information inside the opening tags (like `href`, `src`, and `alt`) other than the element name.

These additional pieces of information are called **attributes**.

They are always specified in the opening tag and come in name/value pairs like this: `name="value"`.

Most attributes are specific to certain types of HTML elements. 

For example:
-  the `href` attribute is used with `<a>` (anchor) elements to specify the URL of the link
- the `src` and `alt` attributes are used with `<img>` (image) elements to specify the image source and alternative text, respectively.

Attributes common to all types of HTML elements include the below:

- **id**: A unique identifier for the element.
- **class**: Specifies one or more class names for the element.

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" id="example-link" class="example-class">Visit Example</a>
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Note">
    Attribute values should always be enclosed in quotation marks (`""`)!
</Callout>

### Content
Content is the information or elements within a pair of opening and closing tags. It can include text, images, links, and other HTML elements.
```html
<body>
    <h1>Main Title</h1>
    <div>
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image">
    </div>
</body>
```

Here, "Main Title" is the content of the `<h1>` element.

The `<img>` element is the content of the `<div>` element. 

The `<body>` element contains both the `<h1>` and `<div>` elements as its content.
