# The Document Object Model (DOM)
The power of JavaScript in web development largely comes from its ability to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM). As mentioned before, the DOM is essentially our representation of the webpage itself.
With JavaScript, you can dynamically change the content, structure, and style of the webpage after it has been loaded in the browser.
All this is made possible through the DOM API, which provides a set of methods and properties to access and manipulate the elements of the DOM tree.

## Accessing the DOM with JavaScript
Any interaction with the webpage using JavaScript typically starts with accessing the DOM. The DOM can be accessed through the global `document` object in JavaScript.

### Selecting Elements
You can select elements in the DOM using various methods provided by the `document` object. Some useful methods include:
- `getElementById(id)`: Selects a single element by its ID.
- `getElementsByClassName(className)`: Selects all elements with a specific class name.
- `getElementsByTagName(tagName)`: Selects all elements with a specific tag name.
- `querySelector(selector)`: Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
- `querySelectorAll(selector)`: Selects all elements that match a CSS selector.
