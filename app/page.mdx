# Welcome!
This site is intended to be companion for students taking the web design course offered by Mission Bit. 
Please use this as a resource to help you understand the core concepts of web design including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as you work through the course material and projects.

## What You'll Find Here
Each section of the site corresponds to a major concept covered in the web design course. Within each section, you'll find pages that break down individual topics in more detail. Each page includes explanations, code examples, and interactive demos to help you understand the material better.


This site is not intended to be a comprehensive reference for all things web design. You won't find detailed information on every single HTML tag or CSS property. Instead, the focus is on the core concepts and techniques that are most relevant to beginners learning web design.

You will find many links to external resources throughout the site. These resources include articles, tutorials, videos, and documentation that provide additional information and examples on the topics covered in the course. (including links to information about specific HTML tags and CSS properties!)
