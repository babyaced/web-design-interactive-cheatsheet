# Combining Selectors
Selectors can be combined in CSS to target elements more specifically. Here are some common ways to combine selectors:

## Descendant Selector
The descendant selector targets elements that are descendants of a specified ancestor element. It is represented by a space between two selectors. (Refer back to the [The Document Object Model (DOM) section](/HTML/TheDocumentObjectModel) if you need a refresher on ancestor and descendant elements.)
