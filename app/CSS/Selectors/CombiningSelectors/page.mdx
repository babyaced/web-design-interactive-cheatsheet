# Combining Selectors
Selectors can be combined in CSS to target elements based on their relationship to other elements and also to apply styles more efficiently. Here are some common ways to combine selectors:

## Descendant Selector
The descendant selector targets elements that are descendants of a specified ancestor element. It is represented by a space between two selectors. (Refer back to the [The Document Object Model (DOM) section](/HTML/TheDocumentObjectModel) if you need a refresher on ancestor and descendant elements.)

<HTMLCSSJSPlayground folderPath={"CSS/Selectors/CombiningSelectors/DescendantSelector"} activeFile={"styles.css"}/>

In the example above the selector `footer a` selects all `<a>` elements that are descendants of the `<footer>` element and applies the specified styles to them.
