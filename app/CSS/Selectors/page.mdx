#  What are CSS Selectors?
CSS Selectors are how we select the elements on the page that we want to style.

## Types of CSS Selectors

### The Type Selector
The type selector selects all elements of a given type. For example, to select all `<p>` elements:

<HTMLCSSJSPlayground folderPath={"CSS/Selectors/BasicSelectors/TypeSelector"} activeFile='styles.css'/>

#### When to Use
The type selector is useful when you want to apply styles to all elements of a specific type across your webpage.

### The Class Selector
The class selector selects all elements with a specific class attribute. Classes are defined in HTML using the `class` attribute.

<HTMLCSSJSPlayground folderPath={"CSS/Selectors/BasicSelectors/ClassSelector"} activeFile='styles.css'/>

#### When to Use
The class selector is useful when you want to apply the same styles to multiple elements without affecting other elements of the same type.

### The ID Selector
The ID selector selects a single element with a specific ID attribute. IDs are defined in HTML using the `id` attribute.

<HTMLCSSJSPlayground folderPath={"CSS/Selectors/BasicSelectors/IDSelector"} activeFile='styles.css'/>

#### When to Use
The ID selector is useful when you want to apply styles to a unique element (element that only appears once) on the page. Unique elements would be for example a navigation bar or footer section.

Those selectors are the types of CSS selectors you'll most commonly use. However there are many more advanced selectors available in CSS, which we'll explore now!
