# What are Media Queries?
Media queries are a CSS technique used to apply different styles to a web page based on the characteristics of the device or screen size being used to view it.
They are commonly used in responsive web design to ensure that a website looks good and functions well on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

## How to Use Media Queries
Media queries are defined using the `@media` rule in CSS. The basic syntax of a media query is as follows:
```css
@media (condition) {
    /* CSS rules to apply when the condition is met */
}
```

The `condition` specifies the criteria that must be met for the enclosed CSS rules to be applied. Common conditions include screen width, height, orientation, and resolution.

Open up the following example in a new tab by clicking the CodeSandbox icon to see how media queries work in practice:

### conditions
The `condition` used in a media query can include various features, such as:
- `min-width` and `max-width`: Apply styles based on the width ↔️ of the screen (viewport).
- `min-height` and `max-height`: Apply styles based on the height ↕️ of the screen (viewport).
- `orientation`: Apply styles based on the orientation 🔄 of the device (portrait or landscape).

Most commonly, we use `min-width` and `max-width` to create breakpoints for different screen sizes, this is because on smaller screens the height typically isnt an issue as users can scroll down the page.
`min-width` and `max-width` are simply written like a css property, but without a semicolon at the end.

```css
@media (min-width: 600px) {
    /* CSS rules for screens wider than 600px */
}
@media (max-width: 599px) {
    /* CSS rules for screens narrower than 600px */
}
```

You can also use the greater than or equal to (`>=`) and less than or equal to (`<=`) symbols as shorthand for `min-` and `max-` respectively.

```css
@media (>= 600px) {
    /* CSS rules for screens wider than or equal to 600px */
}
@media (<= 599px) {
    /* CSS rules for screens narrower than or equal to 599px */
}
```

### Example

<HTMLCSSJSPlayground folderPath={"CSS/MediaQueries"} activeFile={"/styles.css"} />

In the example above, we have defined two media queries:
1. The first media query applies styles when the screen width is at least 250px. It changes the background color to lightblue.
2. The second media query applies styles when the screen width is at least 400px. It changes the background color to lightgreen.

When the screen width is less than 250px, the default background color of red is applied.

You don't have to limit yourself to just changing the background color. The most common use of media queries is to adjust the *layout* of a webpage for different screen sizes.
We'll get into how you can use media queries with layout properties like Flexbox and Grid in their respective sections.
