# Media Queries with Flexbox

A common pattern when using Flexbox is to use a flex-direction of `column` on smaller screens (like mobile devices) and switch to `row` on larger screens (like tablets and desktops). 

This allows the content to stack vertically on small screens for better readability and use the horizontal space more effectively on larger screens.

You can also use the `flex-wrap` property to make content that doesn't fit on one line wrap to the next line on smaller screens.
