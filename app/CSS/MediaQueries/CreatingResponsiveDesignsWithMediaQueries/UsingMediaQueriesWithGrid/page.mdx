# Media Queries with Grid

Grid layouts can also benefit from media queries to create responsive designs. You can adjust the number of columns, rows, and the size of grid items based on the screen size.

In this example we will create a grid layout for the main content that has two columns on larger screens and switches to a single column on smaller screens.
