# What are CSS Rules?
CSS rules are the building blocks of CSS that define how HTML elements should be styled. A CSS rule consists of a **selector** and a **declaration block**. 

The **selector** specifies which HTML elements the rule applies to. 

The **declaration block** contains one or more declarations that define the styles to be applied.

## CSS Rule Structure
```css
selector { /*start of the declaration block */ 
    property: value;
    property: value;
} /* end of the declaration block */
```

As you can see the CSS rule starts with a **selector** followed by a space and an opening curly brace `{`. 

Inside the curly braces, we have one or more **declarations**, each consisting of a **property** and a **value**, separated by a colon `:` and ending with a semicolon `;`. 

Finally, the declaration block is closed with a closing curly brace `}`.

Now let's talk a little bit more about selectors.
