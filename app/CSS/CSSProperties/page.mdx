# What are CSS Properties?
CSS properties are the individual aspects of an element's style that can be modified using CSS. Each property has a specific name and accepts certain values that determine how the property affects the appearance of the element.

## CSS Property Structure
A CSS property is defined within a declaration block of a CSS rule. The structure of a CSS property is as follows:
```css
property: value;
```

- **Property**: This is the name of the CSS property you want to modify (e.g., `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, etc.).
    - Property names are always written in lowercase and use hyphens `-` to separate multiple words.
- **Value**: This is the specific value you want to assign to the property (e.g., `red`, `16px`, `10px`, etc.).
    - Values can be keywords, lengths, colors, percentages, URLs, and more, depending on the property. You'll have to refer to the documentation for each property to see what values are accepted.
- **Semicolon (`;`)**: Each property-value pair ends with a semicolon to separate it from the next declaration in the block.

### Shorthands
Some CSS properties have shorthand versions that allow you to set multiple related properties in a single declaration. For example, the `margin` property is a shorthand for setting the `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and `margin-left` properties all at once.
So this:
```css
margin-top: 10px;
margin-right: 15px;
margin-bottom: 10px;
margin-left: 15px;
```
Can be written as:
```css
margin: 10px 15px;
```

Look out for these shorthands as they can make your CSS files shorter and easier to read. We will cover some useful shorthands in this section as well.
