# What are CSS Properties?
CSS properties are the individual aspects of an element's style that can be modified using CSS. Each property has a specific name and accepts certain values that determine how the property affects the appearance of the element.

## CSS Property Structure
A CSS property is defined within a declaration block of a CSS rule. The structure of a CSS property is as follows:
```css
property: value;
```

- **Property**: This is the name of the CSS property you want to modify (e.g., `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, etc.).
    - Property names are always written in lowercase and use hyphens `-` to separate multiple words.
- **Value**: This is the specific value you want to assign to the property (e.g., `red`, `16px`, `10px`, etc.).
- **Semicolon (`;`)**: Each property-value pair ends with a semicolon to separate it from the next declaration in the block.

### Shorthands
Some CSS properties have shorthand versions that allow you to set multiple related properties in a single declaration. For example, the `margin` property is a shorthand for setting the `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, and `margin-left` properties all at once.
So this:
```css
margin-top: 10px;
margin-right: 15px;
margin-bottom: 10px;
margin-left: 15px;
```
Can be written as:
```css
margin: 10px 15px;
```

Look out for these shorthands as they can make your CSS files shorter and easier to read. We will cover some useful shorthands in this section as well.

## CSS Values

Values can be keywords, lengths, colors, percentages, URLs, and more, depending on the property. You'll have to refer to the documentation for each property to see what values are accepted.

But here is more information on values in general:

### Keywords
Keywords are predefined words that represent specific values for certain CSS properties. For example, the `display` property can take keywords like `block`, `inline`, `flex`, and `grid` to define how an element is displayed on the page.

```css
display: flex;
```

### Units

Numerical values in CSS often require units to specify measurements. Common units include:
- **Pixels (`px`)**: A fixed unit representing a specific number of pixels on the screen.
    ```css
    width: 200px;
    ```
- **Ems (`em`)**: A relative unit based on the font size of the parent element.
    ```css
    font-size: 1.5em; /* 1.5 times the font size of the parent element */
    ```
- **Rems (`rem`)**: A relative unit based on the font size of the root element (usually the `<html>` element).
    ```css
    font-size: 2rem; /* 2 times the font size of the root element */
    ```
- **Percentages (`%`)**: A relative unit based on the size of the parent element.
    - A value of `100%` is commonly used to make an element take up the full width or height of its parent.
    ```css
    width: 50%; /* 50% of the parent element's width */
    ```




### Default Values
Each CSS property has a default value that is applied if no specific value is set. You can override these defaults by explicitly setting the property in your CSS.

Different types of elements have different default styles applied by the browser. For example, links (`<a>` elements) are typically blue and underlined by default. You can override these defaults using CSS properties:
```css
a {
    /* color: blue; */ /* Default value for links is usually blue */
    color: red; /* This will override the default and set the link color to red */
    /* text-decoration: underline; */ /* Default value for links is usually underline */
    text-decoration: none; /* This will override the default and remove the underline */
}
```
When you set certain properties on an element, it can also set default values for related properties. 
    
For example, setting the `display` property to `flex` on a container element will also set default values for properties like `flex-direction` and `justify-content` on that container.
```css
.container {
    display: flex; /* This sets the container to use Flexbox layout */
    /* Default values applied by the browser */
    /* flex-direction: row; */
    /* justify-content: flex-start; */
}
```

One of the most important group of CSS properties to understand are the layout properties, which we will cover next, starting with the Box Model properties!
