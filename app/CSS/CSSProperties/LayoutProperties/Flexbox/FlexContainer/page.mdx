# What is a Flex Container?
A flex container is the element that holds all your flex items. 

## How to Create a Flex Container
To create a flex container, you need to set the `display` property of an element to `flex` or `inline-flex'.

## The two axes of a Flex Container
In a flex container, there are two axes that determine the layout of the flex items:
- The **main axis**: This is the primary axis along which the flex items are laid out. The direction of the main axis is determined by the `flex-direction` property.
- The **cross axis**: This is the axis perpendicular to the main axis. The cross axis is used for aligning flex items in the container.

When the `flex-direction` of a flex container is set to `row`, the main axis runs horizontally (left to right), and the cross axis runs vertically (top to bottom).

When the `flex-direction` of a flex container is set to `column`, the main axis runs vertically (top to bottom), and the cross axis runs horizontally (left to right).

## Flex Container Properties

### Defining the Direction of Flex Items (`flex-direction`)
You can define the direction in which the flex items are laid out using the `flex-direction` property. The most common values used are:
- `row` (default): Flex items are laid out in a row, from left to right.

<HTMLCSSJSPlayground folderPath={"CSS/Layout/Flexbox/TheFlexContainer/FlexDirection/Row"} />
- `column`: Flex items are laid out in a column, from top to bottom.
<HTMLCSSJSPlayground folderPath={"CSS/Layout/Flexbox/TheFlexContainer/FlexDirection/Column"} />

You can also layout the flex items in reverse order (from how they are written in the HTML) using:
- `row-reverse`: Flex items are laid out in a row, from right to left.
- `column-reverse`: Flex items are laid out in a column, from bottom to top.

### Wrapping Flex Items (`flex-wrap`)
By default, flex items will try to fit into one line. You can change this behavior using the `flex-wrap` property. The most common values used are:
- `nowrap` (default): All flex items will be on one line.
<HTMLCSSJSPlayground folderPath={"CSS/Layout/Flexbox/TheFlexContainer/NoWrap"} />
- `wrap`: Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
<HTMLCSSJSPlayground folderPath={"CSS/Layout/Flexbox/TheFlexContainer/FlexWrap"} />
- `wrap-reverse`: Flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from bottom to top.


### Aligning Flex Items Along the Main Axis (`justify-content`)
You can align the flex items along the main axis (the direction defined by `flex-direction`) using the `justify-content` property. The most common values used are:
- `flex-start` (default): Flex items are packed toward the start of the main axis.
- `flex-end`: Flex items are packed toward the end of the main axis.
- `center`: Flex items are centered along the main axis.
- `space-between`: Flex items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line.
- `space-around`: Flex items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them.

### Aligning Flex Items Along the Cross Axis (`align-items`)
You can align the flex items along the cross axis (perpendicular to the main axis) using the `align-items` property. The most common values used are:
- `stretch` (default): Flex items are stretched to fill the container.
- `flex-start`: Flex items are aligned to the start of the cross axis.
- `flex-end`: Flex items are aligned to the end of the cross axis.
- `center`: Flex items are centered along the cross axis.

### Setting Gaps Between Flex Items (`gap`, `row-gap`, `column-gap`)
You can set gaps between flex items using the `gap`, `row-gap`, and `column-gap` properties.
