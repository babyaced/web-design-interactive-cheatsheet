# What are the Flex Items?
Flex items are the direct children of a flex container. They can be positioned and sized within the flex container using various CSS properties.

We will cover the most commonly used flex item properties below.

## Flex Item Properties

### Alignment Properties

#### The `align-self` Property
The `align-self` property allows you to align **individual** flex items along the **cross axis** (vertical axis in a row layout, horizontal axis in a column layout). The possible values are:

- `auto` (default): The item inherits the alignment from the flex container's `align-items` property.
- `flex-start`: Aligns the item to the start of the cross axis.
- `flex-end`: Aligns the item to the end of the cross axis.
- `center`: Centers the item along the cross axis.
- `stretch`: Stretches the item to fill the container along the cross axis.

<Callout type="default" title="Note">
    For these examples I'll be using `align-items: center;` on the flex container to better demonstrate the effects of justify-self and align-self on individual flex items.

    (Except when demonstrating `align-self: center;` of course)

### Flex Sizing Properties
#### The `flex-grow` Property
The `flex-grow` property specifies how much a flex item should grow relative to the other flex items in the container when there is extra space available. 

The default value is `0`, meaning the item will not grow. 
A value of `1` means the item will grow to fill the available space.



#### The `flex-shrink` Property
The `flex-shrink` property specifies how much a flex item should shrink relative to the other flex items in the container when there is not enough space available.
The default value is `1`, meaning the item will shrink if necessary.
A value of `0` means the item will not shrink.

#### The `flex-basis` Property
The `flex-basis` property specifies the initial size of a flex item before any growing or shrinking occurs. 
It can be set to a specific length (e.g., `100px`, `20%`) or to `auto`, which means the item will size itself based on its content.
