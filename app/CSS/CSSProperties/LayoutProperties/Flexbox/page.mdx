# What is Flexbox?
A flexbox layout is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. The main idea behind flexbox is to give a container the ability to alter its items' width, height, and order to best fill the available space.


A Flexbox layout consists of a **flex container** and **flex items**. The **flex container** is the parent element that holds the **flex items**, which are the child elements inside the container.
