# What is the Box Model?
The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design that describes how elements on a webpage are structured and how their dimensions are calculated. 
In the box model, every HTML element is represented as a rectangular box, which consists of four main components: content, padding, border, and margin.

<BoxModelSVG alt="Box Model Diagram" className="w-full h-auto object-contain" style={{margin: "2em 1em"}}/>

- **Content**: This is the innermost part of the box where the actual content (text, images, etc.) of the HTML Element is displayed. The size of the content area can be controlled using properties like `width` and `height`.
- **Padding**: This is the space between the content and the border. Padding creates extra space inside the box, and its size can be adjusted using the `padding` property.
- **Border**: This is the line that surrounds the padding (if any) and content. The border's thickness, style, and color can be customized using properties like `border-width`, `border-style`, and `border-color`.
- **Margin**: This is the outermost layer of the box, which creates space between the element and other elements on the page. The margin can be adjusted using the `margin` property.

Here is an editable example of the Box Model in action:

<HTMLCSSJSPlayground folderPath={"CSS/Layout/TheBoxModel"} activeFile='styles.css'/>

Here the content is the text "Content" inside the innermost box. 

The green area around it is the Padding.

The yellow area surrounding the padding is the Border.

And the brown area surrounding the border is the Margin.
