# What is Grid?

A grid layout is a powerful tool for creating complex and responsive web designs. It allows you to define rows and columns, making it easy to align and distribute content across a page.

<GridOverview style={{margin: "2em"}}/>

- **Grid Tracks**: These are the rows and columns that make up the grid. You can define the size of each track using properties like `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns`.
- **Grid Cells**: These are the individual spaces created by the intersection of rows and columns. Each cell can hold content, and you can control how content spans across multiple cells.
- **Grid Gaps**: These are the spaces between rows and columns. You can set the size of the gaps using the `gap` property.
- **Grid Areas**: These are sections of the grid that can be named and referenced when placing items. You can define grid areas using the `grid-template-areas` property.
- **Grid Lines**: These are the lines that separate the rows and columns. You can reference grid lines when positioning items within the grid.

        When working with grid items, you position them using references to grid line numbers. This can be a bit confusing because the line numbers start at 1, not 0.
        
        So the first column/row is between lines 1 and 2, the second column/row is between lines 2 and 3, and so on. Keep this in mind when defining the placement of grid items!

This whole layout pictured above is called the Grid Container. Let's learn a bit more about it.
