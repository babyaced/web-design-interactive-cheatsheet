# The Grid items

Grid items are the direct children of a grid container. They can be positioned and sized within the grid using various CSS properties.

## Grid Item Properties

### Setting the Start and End Positions (`grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end`, `grid-row-start`, `grid-row-end`)

You can control the start and end positions of a grid item within the grid by using the `grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end`, `grid-row-start`, and `grid-row-end` properties. These properties allow you to specify the grid lines where the item should start and end.

### Positioning Grid Items in the Grid (`grid-column`, `grid-row`)

You can control the position of a grid item within the grid by using the `grid-column` and `grid-row` properties. These properties allow you to specify the start and end lines for the item.
