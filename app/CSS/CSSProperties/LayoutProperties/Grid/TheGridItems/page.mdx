# The Grid items

Grid items are the direct children of a grid container. They can be positioned and sized within the grid using various CSS properties.

## Grid Item Properties

### Setting the Start and End Positions (`grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end`, `grid-row-start`, `grid-row-end`)

You can control the start and end positions of a grid item within the grid by using the `grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end`, `grid-row-start`, and `grid-row-end` properties. These properties allow you to specify the grid lines where the item should start and end.

- **grid-column-start**: Specifies the starting grid line for a grid item in the horizontal direction.
- **grid-column-end**: Specifies the ending grid line for a grid item in the horizontal direction.
- **grid-row-start**: Specifies the starting grid line for a grid item in the vertical direction.
- **grid-row-end**: Specifies the ending grid line for a grid item in the vertical direction.

#### Example
<HTMLCSSJSPlayground folderPath={"CSS/Layout/Grid/GridItems/RowColumnStartAndEnd"} activeFile={"styles.css"}/>

You can also use the shorthand properties `grid-column` and `grid-row` to set both the start and end positions in a single declaration. 

<HTMLCSSJSPlayground folderPath={"CSS/Layout/Grid/GridItems/RowColumnShorthand"} activeFile={"styles.css"}/>

Isn't that much easier to read and write?
