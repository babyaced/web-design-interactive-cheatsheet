# What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is the way we style our webpages. With CSS, we can control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of our HTML elements.

## How to Use CSS
In order to use CSS on your webpage, you must do the following:
1. Create a CSS file with a `.css` extension. This file will contain all your CSS rules.
2. Link the CSS file to your HTML document using the `<link>` tag within the `<head>` section.
   
For example if your CSS file is named `styles.css`, you would add the following code to the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

Notice the `rel` attribute. `rel` stands for "relationship" and it tells the browser that the linked file is a stylesheet.

The `href` attribute specifies the file path to your CSS file. Make sure the file path is correct so that the browser can find and load your CSS file.

And that's it! You can now start writing CSS rules to style your webpage.
